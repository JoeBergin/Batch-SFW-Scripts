<p> There are a number of offline batch processing scripts here.</p>

<p>Each script has its own documentation file.</p>

<p>The scripts are:</p>

<p>appendFile.rb -- appends one json page to another</p>

<p>cleanJournal.rb -- removes journal entries making the page appear "fresh"</p>

<p>createSummary.rb -- creates an index of the files for a site.</p>

<p>renamePage.rb -- renames a json page and updates references to it.</p>

<p>splitFile.rb -- splits a json file into multiple parts.</p>

<p>All of these are intended to aid the initial creation of a SFW site from other documents. Their actions are not performed on a live server, but write output to a separate directory for evaluation and possible staging into a server. </p>

<p> The files in scripts/originals are not important. They are just for testing.</p>
